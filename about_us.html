        Name: Gairo Rodriguez<br>
        College: Upcoming Freshmen at the City College of New York<br>
        Intented Major: Computer Science<br>
        Hobbies: Playing Yugioh, Watching Anime, Drawing, Running, Browsing
        Reddit, and Watching Youtube Videos<br>
        Fun Fact: My friends and I got in-school suspension for two days for
        writing "Leadership has 10 letters. It is mentioned 7 times in the
        passage. 10 - 7 = 3. A triange (Δ) has 3 sides. Δ Illuminati confirmed
        Δ" on a classwork assignment (Imagine what it was like explaining this
        to colleges in my disciplinary history). What's funny is that one of my
        friends was just laughing at what my friend and I wrote and got
        suspended for something he wasn't even apart of.
