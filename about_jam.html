      <p class=about_jam_text> Have you ever been in a room and one person just plays horrible music? Our app, Jam, solves this problem! Everyone in a room can pick the most played songs collabratively through a voting system. Anyone can add songs to the playlit and vote for which songs they'd like to listen to! <br> With our app, users can add songs to a playlist and vote for which song they like. The songs are then sorted according to their vote count. Songs with the highest votes are played first, and songs with the lowest votes are played last. </p>
